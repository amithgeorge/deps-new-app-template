# com.amithgeorge/app-template

FIXME: my new template.

## Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

This is a template project for use with [deps-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new).
As originally generated, it will produce a new library project when run:

    $ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {com.amithgeorge/app-template {:local/root "."}}}' -Tnew create :template com.amithgeorge/app-template :name myusername/mycoollib

Assuming you have installed `deps-new` as your `new` "tool" via:

```bash
clojure -Ttools install io.github.seancorfield/deps-new '{:git/tag "v0.3.3"}' :as new
```

> Note: once the template has been published (to a public git repo or to Clojars, etc), the invocation will be the same, except the `:local/root` dependency will be replaced by a git or Maven-like coordinate.

Run this template project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run this template project's CI pipeline and build a JAR (this will fail until you edit the tests to pass):

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the JAR in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

Install it locally (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment
variables (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build deploy

Your library will be deployed to com.amithgeorge/app-template on clojars.org by default.
